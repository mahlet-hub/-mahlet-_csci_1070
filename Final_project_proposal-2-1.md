Final Project Proposal https://github.com/mahlet-hub/mahlet_csci_1070/tree/main

For this project , I will be working alone .
My plan will be to simply address what dataset I will use for the project , make a hypothesis for the data set , pre-process the data ,  make the models , run said models , and evaluate my results in comparison to the hypothesis I made previously.
I will be using the hulu movie data set for my final project .

Null hypothesis : The release date , genre  and available country of an applicant does not significantly affect the probability of the movie having a good rating
Alternative hypothesis : The release date , genre  and available country will significantly affect the probability of the movie having a good rating 
Models I plan on using for this data set are logistic regression , linear regression and random forest classifier 
I plan on working this after class on mondays , wednesdays , and fridays.
