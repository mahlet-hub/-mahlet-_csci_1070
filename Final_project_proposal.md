Final Project Proposal 

For this project , I will be working alone .
My plan will be to simply address what dataset I will use for the project , make a hypothesis for the data set , pre-process the data ,  make the models , run said models , and evaluate my results in comparison to the hypothesis I made previously.
I will be using the credit card approval data set for my final project .
Null hypothesis : The income level of an applicant does not significantly affect the probability of credit card approval.
Alternative hypothesis : The income level of an applicant will significantly affect the probability of credit card approval.
Models I plan on using for this data set are KNN , logistic regression , linear regression and ROC curve .
